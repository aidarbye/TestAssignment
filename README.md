# TestAssignment
Test Assignment for Strong Summer Internship

Notes:

The test job was done, only [non-UI testing] from Advanced was not done.
Also while working with API I used only one general API - [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all].

Advanced assignments that I completed
  Using SwiftUI only
  Using “skeleton views” for all the elements while API requests are performed.
  Make the UI look and feel good for all the screen sizes including iPads.
  Make the expand/collapse feature for CountriesList animated, with no UI bugs.
  Add the images caching and reuse them from cache (don’t download any image twice).
  Use “nice” naming (common readability, self-documenting code)
  Follow any of the architectures (MVVM)
  Write safe code, leave no possibility of crashes (correct optionals, array indices handling etc.)
  Make the “Capital coordinates” latitude + longitude value on the CountryDetails screen tappable;
  on tap open the link obtained from the “maps → openStreetMaps”.
  Add all the pushes feature.
